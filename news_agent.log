In criminal trials on both sides of the Atlantic from 2015 to 2019, 19 were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and nine were sent to jail.; As they served time, evidence emerged that central bankers and government officials across the world, including a top adviser at 10 Downing Street at the time, had pressured banks such as theirs to engage in very similar conduct to what they were jailed for – but on a much greater scale. No central banker or government official was prosecuted.Then, soon after they were released after serving their full jail tariffs, a US appeal court decided such conduct wasn\'t a crime after all; nor even against any rules. The US Department of Justice revoked the charges against Tom Hayes, and the US courts then threw out all similar convictions. Yet in the UK, they remain convicted criminals.; The Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted the cases, says the defendants were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and points to a number of previous unsuccessful attempts to overturn convictions at the Court of Appeal.The Supreme Court\'s now being asked to decide if judges were wrong to tell juries their conduct was unlawful. If it does so, it could lead to the overturning of all remaining convictions, throwing a global 17-year scandal into reverse.; It\'s also likely to prompt renewed calls for a public inquiry into evidence of much larger interest rate "rigging" – ordered from the top of the financial system by central banks and governments worldwide.This is the first time the cases have reached the Supreme Court following public pressure from senior politicians, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and former Brexit Secretary David Davis. They have told the BBC they\'re concerned the traders have been "scapegoated" in a scandalous series of miscarriages of justice that runs "deeper than the Post Office".They want a public inquiry.; What the FTSE 100 or the Dow Jones are to share prices, Libor is to interest rates: an index, updated every day, that tracked the cost of borrowing cash between the banks from 1986 until 2024.Each day at 11am, 16 banks across London would answer a question: at what interest rate could they borrow money?Before answering, traders on the banks\' cash desks would look at the range of interest rates at which other banks on the market were offering to lend cash, which normally differed from each other by just one or two hundredths of a percentage point (e.g. HSBC offering to lend funds at 3.14%, Bank of China at 3.16%, JP Morgan at 3.15%).Each bank would then select a rate from that range of offers to submit as their answer. An average would then be taken to get the official benchmark, Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate). A similar process was used to get Euribor, the equivalent of Libor for euros.; The evidence against Hayes and Palombo were messages they had sent to the cash traders asking them to select a \'high\' or \'low\' rate from that range, depending on what might benefit their banks\' trades – which went up or down in value linked to Libor (or Euribor).Their requests might make no difference to the average; or they might nudge it very slightly in their bank\'s favour – up or down by no more than one eighth of one hundredth of a percentage point (0.00125%). But it was seen as worth the effort of making the requests, which had been industry practice for years, in case it might help their bank make more money or lose less.Prosecutors alleged Hayes was dishonestly seeking to manipulate the Libor rate to benefit the bank\'s trading positions and therefore his bonuses while "cheating" others trading on the market, "motivated by pure greed". The SFO accused Palombo of being a "crook" and a "cheat" who had "left his moral compass at home".; The traders protested that any potential gains to their bonuses from a nudge to Libor of a maximum 0.00125% were far too little to motivate a criminal conspiracy.What they saw as the clerical task of choosing \'high\' or \'low\' rates based on the commercial interests of the bank - was merely what every bank had done since the 1980s, long before they started work.But according to the SFO, it was interest rate "manipulation" that amounted to evidence of an international conspiracy to defraud.At his 2015 trial, Hayes said he had not asked for any false answers to be given to the Libor question – but merely tried to ensure his bank selected a commercially advantageous rate from the range of accurate interest rates at which it could genuinely borrow.But the judge, Mr Justice Jeremy Cooke, decided that any attempt to take into account commercial interests when submitting a Libor rate was "self-evidently" unlawful. Sentencing Hayes to 14 years, he dismissed the argument that it was City practice."The fact that others were doing the same as you is no excuse, nor is the fact that your immediate managers saw the benefit of what you were doing and condoned and embraced it, if not encouraged it.[…] The conduct involved here must be marked out as dishonest and wrong and a message sent to the world of banking accordingly."; The defendants say court rulings retrospectively criminalised not only their actions years before, but also those of senior bankers and civil servants, much higher up the financial pecking order, who had sought to influence Libor on a much greater scale.Audio recordings, documents and data uncovered by the BBC indicate that in the 2008 financial crisis, governments and central banks from the Bank of England to the Banque de France and Banca d\'Italia pressured banks to push Libor and Euribor down artificially in order to make real interest rates appear lower than they were and quell speculation about banks\' solvency - a highly commercial motive.The difference, though, was that whereas the traders were asking for shifts of one hundredth of a percentage point, the central banks sought moves up to 50 times the size, giving rates that were obviously false, far away from the range of interest rates where cash was being borrowed or lent on the money markets. In a BBC Radio 4 podcast series exposing the scandal, The Lowball Tapes, Palombo asks despairingly, "If that\'s not criminal, how can I be a criminal?"; Contemporary emails and phone transcripts, official interviews by the FBI and first-hand accounts of witnesses point to the involvement of top officials at Downing Street and the Treasury. They were not shown to the juries at the traders\' trials.Palombo describes his life since being prosecuted as a "Kafka nightmare" where he could barely understand the accusations made against him, with no sense of having done anything even vaguely wrong.To him and to Hayes, one of the most serious implications is that what happened to them could happen to anyone in the workplace - to them, if normal commercial practice can be retroactively criminalised, no-one can be sure that the daily tasks they\'re currently engaged in at work won\'t, in years to come, be condemned and prosecuted.; The Treasury has said it did not seek to influence individual bank Libor submissions.The Bank of England has said Libor was not regulated at the time. The Banque de France, Banca d\'Italia and the Federal Reserve have declined to comment.In the traders\' cases the Court of Appeal, led by judges including Lord Chief Justice John Thomas and Lord Justice Nigel Davis, blocked the path to the Supreme Court five times from 2015 to 2019. In 2021, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) initially said it would turn down Hayes\'s application.But then in January 2022 a US appeal court fully acquitted two former Deutsche Bank traders, Matt Connolly and Gavin Black, saying prosecutors had failed to produce any evidence they had asked for false rates to be submitted at which their banks could not borrow.; All US convictions for \'rigging\' Libor were subsequently thrown out. The pair had initially been convicted in 2018 on similar charges to Hayes and Palombo.The following year, the CCRC was persuaded to change its mind. In 2024, Court of Appeal judges certified, for the first time in these cases, that there was a point of law of general public importance at stake, finally clearing the path to the Supreme Court.Two months ago, the Supreme Court heard arguments that judges in the lower courts had told juries that Hayes and Palombo\'s requests were wrong as a matter of law – when it should have been left as a matter of fact for the jury to decide. The SFO told the court the defendants didn\'t challenge the jury directions at the time.Hayes and Palombo now await the Supreme Court\'s judgement.', 'videos': [], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn1f8c/live/31bc6830-3714-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn1b7c/live/74f05860-3713-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn0252/live/b9396540-3716-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn6eaf/live/718e6370-37e9-11f0-8947-7d6241f9fce9.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xnf5d1/live/24ba4240-3716-11f0-8947-7d6241f9fce9.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn70b9/live/9bed21b0-3717-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': 'MoD official took £70,000 in secret payments', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-68800504'}, {'article_title': 'Jailed bankers appeal ‘must’ go to top court', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68716629'}, {'article_title': 'Bankers jailed for interest rate rigging lose appeal', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68595204'}], 'keyword': "Rate 'rigging' traders say they were scapegoated - now the Supreme Court will decide", 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:43.425Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rp94jr79po', 'keyword': "Rate 'rigging' traders say they were scapegoated - now the Supreme Court will decide"}}, {'id': 'c4g2wz74jdzo', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2wz74jdzo', 'author': 'Jaroslav Lukiv', 'headline': "Trump calls Putin 'absolutely crazy' after largest Russian attack on Ukraine", 'topics': [], 'publication_date': '2025-05-26T04:37:41.079Z', 'content': 'US President Donald Trump has said he is "not happy" with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, following Moscow\'s largest aerial attack yet on Ukraine.In a rare rebuke, Trump said: "What the hell happened to him? He\'s killing a lot of people." He later called Putin "absolutely crazy".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier said Washington\'s "silence" over recent Russian attacks was encouraging Putin, urging "strong pressure" - including tougher sanctions - on Moscow.At least 12 people were killed and dozens injured in Ukraine overnight Sunday after Russia fired 367 drones and missiles - the highest number in a single night since Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022.; Air sirens warning of incoming drones and missiles sounded again in many regions of Ukraine early on Monday.At least three people, including a child, were injured in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.In the southern Zaporizhzhia region, two people were injured, said regional head Ivan Fedorov.In Russia, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said two Ukrainian drones heading towards the capital were destroyed by air defence units. No injuries were reported.Speaking to reporters in New Jersey late on Sunday, Trump said of Putin: "I\'ve known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he\'s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don\'t like it at all."Asked about whether he was considering increasing US sanctions on Russia, Trump replied: "Absolutely." The US president has repeatedly threatened to do this before - but is yet to implement any restrictions against Moscow.Shortly afterwards, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that Putin "has gone absolutely crazy"."I\'ve always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that\'s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!"But the US president also had strong words for Zelensky, saying that he "is doing his country no favours by talking the way he does"."Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don\'t like it, and it better stop," Trump wrote of Zelensky.; Despite Kyiv\'s European allies preparing further sanctions for Russia, the US has said it will either continue trying to broker these peace talks, or "walk away" if progress does not follow.Last week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed ceasefire deal to halt the fighting.The US president said he believed the call had gone "very well", adding that Russia and Ukraine would "immediately start" negotiations toward a ceasefire and "an end to the war".Ukraine has publicly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire.Putin has only said Russia will work with Ukraine to craft a "memorandum" on a "possible future peace" - a move described by Kyiv and its European allies as delaying tactics. The first direct Ukrainian-Russian talks since 2022 were held on 16 May in Istanbul, Turkey.Aside from a major prisoner of war swap last week, there was little or no progress on bringing a pausing in fighting closer.Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. This includes Crimea - Ukraine\'s southern peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014.', 'videos': [{'video_description': "Watch: Trump says he is 'not happy' with Putin over Ukraine attacks"}], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn335a/live/8e11aff0-39d0-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': "'We didn't see it as treason': The Russian couple who became informants for Ukraine", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqq18evyko'}, {'article_title': "Zelensky says 'US silence' over Russian attacks encourages Putin", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2rx8kxdm4o'}, {'article_title': 'Thirteen killed in wave of Russian attacks across Ukraine', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy908n4vr0jo'}], 'keyword': "Trump calls Putin 'crazy' after largest Russian attack on Ukraine", 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:56.622Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2wz74jdzo', 'keyword': "Trump calls Putin 'crazy' after largest Russian attack on Ukraine"}}, {'id': 'cwyvqqr51pno', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyvqqr51pno', 'author': 'Craig Williams', 'headline': ' The rise and fall of Michelle Mone: A self-created fairy story', 'topics': [], 'publication_date': '2025-05-25T23:39:00.659Z', 'content': 'Michelle Mone spent 25 years building her business empire and public profile through the British media.A brilliant self-publicist, she was regularly described as one of the UK\'s most successful businesswomen. She was the plucky underdog who, through sheer grit and a knack for a good headline, pushed her Ultimo bra concept onto the marketplace and into the high street\'s biggest shops.She even claimed to have given Hollywood star Julia Roberts a cleavage.The story she told time and time again to a grateful media brought her fame, riches, and even a peerage. But Baroness Mone of Mayfair has now been stripped of the Conservative whip, is on leave from the House of Lords and a business connected to her is under investigation by the National Crime Agency.How did it come to that?; That\'s the question a new two-part BBC Scotland documentary seeks to answer. The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone begins in 1999 as the then 28-year-old talks her way into Selfridges in London, and a deal to sell her gel-filled Ultimo bra.Born in her own words "into nothing", Mone was raised in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow. She left school at 15 with no qualifications but a determination "to make something of myself". Friends from the time describe her hard work ethic, energy and "bubbly" nature. "No matter where you\'re from, look at me, you can do it," she would later say.She worked as a model and "ring girl" at boxing matches and moved into promotions and sales before setting up MJM International with husband Michael.They re-mortgaged their house and went £70,000 into debt developing the Ultimo Bra, which is when Mone turned up unannounced at Selfridges.Virginia Marcolin was the shop\'s lingerie buyer, and the person Mone had travelled to London to see."I thought: \'This girl is not what I\'m used to dealing with\'. She was kind of country bumpkin and a little bit like not overly refined, just very authentic. And this was just such a fresh, new product," she says."That was the start of it. It was her persistence."; Mone\'s natural knack for promotion got them the deal but the cash-poor company needed funds to fulfil the order. They found an investor in Tom Hunter, who in 1998 had just sold his sportswear company JJB Sports for £280m.The man who made that introduction was Jack Irvine, former newspaper editor turned successful PR executive. He became a key figure in building Mone\'s early media profile.  The newspapers and broadcasters were hungry for stories about her, and she was very happy to help."She had two driving forces," Irvine says. "One was to be very rich and one was to be very famous."Coverage from that time stressed her humble roots, battle to succeed, new-found wealth, and the global success of her bra.Magnus Llewellin, now editor of the Times newspapers in Scotland, remembers one infamous story from the time."Stories would circulate around Michelle Mone. One of those was that her bra was used in the film Erin Brockovich, that Julia Roberts wore one of her bras," he says."If you actually bother to check, somebody involved in the actual making of the film came out and said an Ultimo bra wasn\'t used in the production."The truth is that the media, especially the Scottish media, helped create the Michelle Mone myth. And she had a gift for using that."The story was almost too good to debunk. A young woman fighting in a male-dominated business world, making a way for herself. That was a great story to tell," Llewellin says.; After more than 20 years together as a couple and more than a decade in business, the Mones very publicly separated, divorcing in 2011.Michelle bought Michael out of the business and became the face and body of the brand, modelling her own lingerie.Behind the scenes at the company there were a number of employment tribunals, including one high-profile case in which a member of staff found a recording device in his office. Despite her legal challenges, Mone remained in the public eye, a regular feature on television programmes. And her knack for publicity led to her next move - into the world of politics. She had been a Labour supporter but defected to the Conservatives in 2010. Four years later she was a prominent voice in favour of the union during the independence referendum, going so far as to say she would leave Scotland in the event of a \'Yes\' vote.In 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron made her his government\'s "entrepreneurship tsar". Within weeks it was announced she was to become a Conservative peer, as Baroness Mone of Mayfair.; By then she had sold her interests in the company she had built. But her new roles brought increased scrutiny over her business record.Magnus Llewellin points out that MJM International never turned over more than £10.1m a year, and in 2012 lost more than half a million pounds."By that time the company was in real trouble," he says.Businessman Donald Anderson runs the Gap Group, a plant hire company which in 2024 had a turnover of £302.3m, employed more than 2,000 people, and made a pre-tax profit of £43.9m.He wrote to the prime minister at the time of Mone\'s appointment."Miss Mone is not a successful entrepreneur, she is a small time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success," he wrote.He now says: "If the only thing she achieved was self-publicity, I don\'t think that\'s a very good reason to put you into the House of Lords. If you follow that logic then the House of Lords will be full of influencers in the next 10 years."; In 2016, Mone announced she was in a new relationship with Doug Barrowman, a billionaire businessman. They settled in the Isle of Man, and worked together in the booming crypto-currency sector. In 2020, the Covid pandemic struck. As the death toll rose, UK ministers sought out firms to urgently supply Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), even setting up a VIP lane to give priority to some suppliers.A company called PPE Medpro made it onto the VIP list. This caught the eye of campaigners who were concerned that firms on the list were run by people with connections to the Conservative Party. It emerged that PPE Medpro was controlled by people connected to Doug Barrowman. Mone, a Conservative peer, repeatedly denied any involvement in the business, the deal or the subsequent profits. But the Guardian uncovered a connection to government ministers.The paper\'s David Conn says: "We did our own freedom of information request, and we got the emails that she\'d sent to Michael Gove and Lord Agnew saying that she was offering to supply PPE through \'my team in Hong Kong\' and that it had gone through the VIP lane."And we also got some WhatsApp messages which Michelle Mone had sent about the PPE deals and she said she was sitting on the jet and it was about to take off, which we assumed was their jet, their private plane."; The National Crime Agency (NCA) launched an investigation into PPE Medpro. Several of the couple\'s properties were raided.Two years into his investigation, David Conn received a leaked document showing Barrowman made at least £65m from the deals, with £29m of this paid into a trust of which Mone and her three adult children are beneficiaries. Throughout this time, Mone was uncharacteristically quiet. But that changed at the end of 2023 when she and Barrowman - by then married - released a PPE Medpro-funded documentary in which she admitted being a "conduit" between the company and ministers.They also agreed to appear on the BBC\'s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. On camera, Mone admitted she could one day benefit from the trust, and said they had done nothing wrong.When asked about lying to the press, she replied: "That\'s not a crime."Saying to the press I\'m not involved, to protect my family, can I just make it clear, it\'s not a crime."Laura Kuenssberg says: "That\'s a phrase that will always stick with me."When she said that, I thought: \'There\'s a thing. There\'s a headline\'."; Michelle Mone lost the Conservative whip and has taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords. She has made no further media appearances.PPE Medpro is still under investigation by the NCA and the government is suing the company for £122m plus costs, claiming the medical gowns the company supplied "did not comply with the specification in the contract".The peer declined the offer to be interviewed for The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone. In response to the programme, a statement said the couple had provided "full and detailed statements to the NCA and cooperated with the investigation throughout".It said they had never been arrested and no charges had been brought against them.The statement also defended PPE Medpro\'s delivery of PPE equipment to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).It continued: "Baroness Mone, along with the whole of the Mone/Barrowman family, were beneficiaries of trusts... never direct recipients of PPE Medpro profits."The DHSC was fully aware of their involvement from the outset. It was a mistake to have misled the press."; Michelle Mone\'s public life was a self-created fairy story which many in business, politics, and especially the media, bought into.For Magnus Llewellin, there\'s a clear moral to this tale."What it does tell us about modern Britain is, we still like fairy tales. We want to believe those rags to riches tales."But once you step into the world of politics, things can get a bit trickier.

It\'s been utterly joyous," he said.Speaking directly into the camera to viewers at home, he added: "And my final thank you goes to all of you."Thank you for watching, thank you for all your love and support over the years."It\'s been so special, and I\'m sorry that your team was always on last. Time to say goodbye."; The former England forward replaced Des Lynam as the main presenter of the BBC\'s flagship football programme in 1999, and went on to become its highest-paid presenter.He hit the headlines for airing his opinions beyond football on social media, however.He was suspended in 2023 for a post about the then-government\'s asylum policy, with numerous fellow BBC Sport presenters and pundits walking out in support.After Lineker was reinstated, the BBC issued new rules for presenters posting on social media.; Earlier this month, Lineker was criticised for sharing a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult.Lineker apologised, saying he had not seen the image and "would never consciously repost anything antisemitic".However, it was then announced he would leave the BBC earlier than expected, and that Sunday\'s show would be his last.In a statement at the time, Lineker said football had been "at the heart of my life" and that he cared deeply about the game and his BBC work, but he recognised "the error and upset that I caused". "Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action," he said.BBC director general Tim Davie thanked Lineker for being "a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades", and said they had "agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season".; Lineker\'s final episode in the presenter\'s chair on Sunday saw him interview Liverpool manager Arne Slot as they collected the Premier League trophy.Slot paid tribute, saying: "Thank you for being such a great presenter of a BBC show that I watched many times when I lived in Holland, and now still."The show began with a montage of former Everton and Spurs striker Lineker\'s goals and later looked back on highlights of his time at the helm of Match of the Day.This included him famously presenting a segment while wearing only his Leicester City boxer shorts, as he had promised, after his boyhood team won the Premier League in 2016.His longstanding sidekicks Shearer and Richards also paid tribute, introducing a montage that included testimonies from the likes of Alan Hansen, Ian Wright and Paul Gascgoine as well as the late Johan Cruyff, singer Andrea Bocelli and Lineker\'s sons."You won\'t believe it but you will be missed," offered Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola."You\'ve been great to me and you\'ve been unbelievable to Match of the Day," added Shearer.In January, it was revealed that Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan would jointly take over Match of the Day presenting responsibilities from the start of the 2025-26 season."I\'d like to wish Gabby, Mark and Kelly all the very best when they sit in this chair," Lineker said."The programme is in the best of hands."', 'videos': [{'video_description': '"It\'s been so special" Gary Lineker\'s final Match of the Day sign-off'}, {'video_description': "Watch: How Gary Lineker's long BBC career came to an abrupt end"}], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn01a9/live/3e8145c0-397d-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': 'Film and TV model maker warns skill may disappear', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d1611rzypo'}, {'article_title': "It's the Doctor Who and The Last of Us finales: What's coming up this week", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdeddkxkjpyo'}, {'article_title': 'BBC arts broadcaster Alan Yentob dies aged 78', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8dp75gw8lo'}], 'keyword': 'Lineker says emotional farewell on final Match of the Day', 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:42.741Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0kwkg7deeo', 'keyword': 'Lineker says emotional farewell on final Match of the Day'}}, {'id': 'c3rpv4lj2g3o', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rpv4lj2g3o', 'author': 'Damian Grammaticas', 'headline': 'HS2 investigating two firms supplying staff for West Midlands leg', 'topics': [], 'publication_date': '2025-05-26T01:18:05.352Z', 'content': 'The company building the HS2 rail line between London and Birmingham says it is investigating "allegations" about the practices of some "labour suppliers" to the project.HS2 Ltd is looking into two firms supplying workers to build the West Midlands section of the high-speed line.It is understood to relate to billing for the staff supplied. The Department for Transport said it would ensure "any claims of wrongdoing in HS2\'s supply chain" were "thoroughly" dealt with.; The existence of HS2\'s investigation, which began earlier this year was first reported by the i newspaper on Monday.According to the paper, the matter relates to misclassification of staff and claims that inflated rates were being charged for them.It is understood the two firms being looked at were providing workers to Balfour Beatty Vinci, one of HS2\'s contractors. A HS2 spokesperson said it treated "all whistleblower allegations seriously", adding that Balfour Beatty Vinci "had implemented additional monitoring and controls".It is understood one of the labour suppliers remains suspended from new contracts while inquiries continue. A Department for Transport spokesman said the government and HS2 "take all whistleblower allegations extremely seriously and have a zero-tolerance attitude towards fraud, bribery, and corruption"."We will therefore ensure any claims of wrongdoing in HS2\'s supply chain are thoroughly investigated."The police and HMRC are not believed to be involved.; Work is currently under way to build the nearly 140-mile high-speed line between London and the West Midlands.The HS2 project was announced in 2009 to boost capacity on England\'s north-south rail links, aiming to reduce journey times, create jobs and boost the UK economy.The original plan was to build the line in two phases - with the first connecting London and Birmingham and the second adding two branches to Manchester and Leeds. But the project has suffered various setbacks and spiralling costs since it was announced and the decision was taken by the last Conservative government to scrap the second phase. The Labour government has said it will not reinstate it.Much of the work London-Birmingham section has been completed - with more than 75% of tunnelling complete, according to HS2 Ltd.Separately, the mayors of Greater Manchester and the West Midlands have revealed plans for a new rail line linking their regions which would rely on private investment and cost less than the scrapped northern leg of HS2.; Official estimates of how much HS2 will cost have changed several times over the years.Last October, the government announced that ministers would take a direct role in overseeing the building of the line to try to "get a grip" on rising costs.The government previously said costs had soared because of factors including "poor project management, inflation and poor performance from the supply chain".In 2012 it was estimated that HS2 Phase 1 (London to Birmingham) would cost £20.5bn (at 2019 prices). The government\'s most recent estimate of the overall cost is between £45bn and £54bn at 2019 prices - but HS2 management have estimated the figure to be more like £49bn to £57bn.According to a House of Commons research briefing, cost increases have been driven "by high inflation, as well as scope changes, worse ground conditions than expected and optimism bias".', 'videos': [], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn5391/live/43d5c8f0-39c5-11f0-afdd-afbf5cfb93f6.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xnba71/live/616abd00-39be-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': "National parking platform seeks to end 'hassle' of multiple parking apps", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg44pgn2g4o'}, {'article_title': 'Greater Anglia to be nationalised in October', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5jvkw1v2o'}, {'article_title': "Wellington station 'still firmly under consideration'", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w2genjxpo'}], 'keyword': 'HS2 investigating two firms supplying construction staff', 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:42.275Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rpv4lj2g3o', 'keyword': 'HS2 investigating two firms supplying construction staff'}}, {'id': 'c5y2kd1nkleo', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2kd1nkleo', 'author': 'Fergal Keane', 'headline': 'BBC returns to Gaza baby left hungry by Israeli blockade', 'topics': [], 'publication_date': '2025-05-25T21:02:12.939Z', 'content': 'There is no excitement as the camera passes. The children barely glance. What can surprise a child who lives among the dead, the dying, the waiting to die? Hunger has worn them down.They wait in queues for scant rations or for none at all. They have grown used to my colleague and his camera,\u202ffilming for the BBC. He witnesses their hunger, their dying, and to the gentle wrapping of their bodies - or fragments of their bodies - in white shrouds upon which their names, if known, are written.For 19 months of war, and now under a renewed Israeli offensive,\u202fthis local cameraman - who I do not name, for his safety -\u202fhas listened to the anguished cries of the survivors in hospital courtyards.His physical distance is respectful, but they are on his mind, day and night. He is one of them, trapped in the same claustrophobic hell.This morning he is setting out to find Siwar Ashour, a five-month-old girl whose emaciated frame and exhausted cry\u202fat Nasser hospital in Khan Younis affected him so much,\u202fwhen he was filming there earlier this month, that he wrote to tell me something had broken inside him.She weighed just over 2kg (4lb 6oz). A baby girl of five months should be about 6kg or over.; Siwar has since been discharged and is now at home, \u202fmy colleague\u202fhas heard. That is what brings him to the street of pulverised houses and makeshift shelters of canvas and corrugated iron.He conducts his search in difficult circumstances.\u202fA few days ago\u202fI messaged to ask how he was doing. "I\u202fam not okay," he replied. "Just\u202fa short while ago, the Israeli army announced the evacuation of most areas of Khan Younis… We don\'t know what to do - there is no safe place to go."Al-Mawasi is extremely overcrowded with displaced people. We are lost and have no idea what the right decision is at this moment."He finds a one-bedroom shack, the entrance formed of a floral patterned, grey and black curtain. Inside there are three mattresses, part of a\u202fchest of drawers, and a mirror which reflects sunlight across the floor in front of Siwar, her mother Najwa and her grandmother, Reem.; Siwar is quiet, held secure by the protective presence of the two women. The baby cannot absorb regular milk formula because of a severe allergic reaction. Under the conditions of war and an Israeli blockade on aid arrivals, there is a severe shortage of the formula she needs.Najwa, 23,\u202fexplains that her condition stabilised when she was in\u202fNasser hospital, so doctors discharged her\u202fwith a can of baby formula several days ago.Now at home, she says the baby\'s weight has started to slip again. "The\u202fdoctors told me that Siwar improved and is better than before, but I think that she is still skinny and hasn\'t improved much. They found her only one can of milk, and it [has]\u202fstarted running out."Flies dance in front of Siwar\'s face. "The\u202fsituation is very dire," says Najwa, "the\u202finsects come at her, I have to cover her with a scarf so nothing touches her".Siwar has lived with the sound of war since last November when she was born. The artillery, the rockets, falling bombs - distant and near. The gunfire,\u202fthe blades of Israeli drones whirring\u202foverhead. Najwa\u202fexplains: "She\u202funderstands these things. The sound of the tanks, warplanes, and rockets are so loud and they are close to us. When Siwar hears these sounds, she gets startled and cries. If she is sleeping, she wakes up startled and crying."Doctors in Gaza say many young mothers report being unable to breastfeed their babies due to lack of nutrition. The pressing problem is food and clean water.Najwa was malnourished herself when Siwar was born. She and her mother Reem still find it difficult to get anything to eat themselves. It is the struggle of every waking hour. "In\u202four case, we can\'t provide milk or diapers because of the prices and the border closure."On 22 May, Israeli military body Cogat said there was no food shortage in Gaza. It said "significant\u202fquantities of baby food and flour for bakeries" had been brought into the enclave in recent days.; The agency\u202fhas repeatedly insisted that Hamas steals aid,\u202fwhile\u202fthe Israeli government says the war will continue until Hamas is destroyed and the Israeli hostages held in Gaza are released. According to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 20 hostages seized by Hamas in the 7 October 2023 attacks\u202fare believed to be alive and up to 30 others\u202fdead.Aid agencies, the United Nations and many foreign governments, including Britain, reject Cogat\'s comment that there is no food shortage. US President Donald Trump has also spoken of people "starving"\u202fin Gaza.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the amount of aid Israel has allowed into Gaza as "a\u202fteaspoon". He said Palestinians were "enduring\u202fwhat may be the cruellest phase of this cruel conflict" with restricted supplies of fuel, shelter, cooking gas and water purification supplies.According to the UN, 80% of Gaza is now either designated as an Israeli militarised zone or a place where people have been ordered to leave.The denials, the expressions of concern, the condemnations and the moments which seemed like turning points have come and gone throughout this war. The sole constant is the suffering of Gaza\'s 2.1 million people, like Najwa and her daughter Siwar."One does not think about the future or the past," Najwa says.There is only the present moment and how to survive it.With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Alice Doyard and Nik Millard.', 'videos': [{'video_description': 'Warning: Upsetting content'}], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xnca7c/live/3edeba20-39a0-11f0-851f-813e3b8ee421.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn0fda/live/9db69fa0-399f-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn2040/live/1a3ad450-39f1-11f0-b220-a104ec6ac9f6.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': 'Father of nine children killed by Israeli strike still in critical condition', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8djlg3zq5o'}, {'article_title': 'Chaos spreads as desperate Gazans wait for food to arrive', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ekv9ez43o'}, {'article_title': "'The mood is changing': Israeli anger grows at conduct of war", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj422k1zzd9o'}], 'keyword': "'Situation is dire' - BBC returns to Gaza baby left hungry by Israeli blockade", 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:48.028Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2kd1nkleo', 'keyword': "'Situation is dire' - BBC returns to Gaza baby left hungry by Israeli blockade"}}, {'id': 'cz9yjj54v3xo', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9yjj54v3xo', 'author': 'Rushdi Abualouf', 'headline': 'Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 24, medics and officials say', 'topics': [], 'publication_date': '2025-05-26T03:43:55.853Z', 'content': 'At least 24 Palestinians have been killed in two separate Israeli air strikes overnight, including a strike on a school sheltering displaced families in central Gaza, according to medics and Civil Defence officials.The strike targeted Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City, which had been housing hundreds of displaced people who fled the northern town of Beit Lahia, currently under intense Israeli military assault.A spokesperson for Gaza\'s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said 20 bodies, including those of children, were recovered from the school – many were severely burned, after fires engulfed two classrooms turned into living quarters.The Israeli military has been contacted for comment.; "Flames were everywhere. I saw charred bodies lying on the ground," said Rami Rafiq, a resident living across from the school, in a phone call with BBC. "My son fainted when he saw the horrific scene."Video footage shared online showed large fires consuming parts of the school, with graphic images of severely burned victims, including children, and survivors suffering critical injuries.Local reports said among the dead was Mohammad Al-Kasih, the head of investigations for the Hamas police in northern Gaza, along with his wife and children.Shortly before the school strike, another Israeli air strike hit a home in central Gaza City, killing four more people, the Hamas-run health ministry said.The twin attacks are part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in the northern part of the enclave over the past week.; On Friday, an Israeli strike on the home of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza killed nine of her 10 children. Dr Alaa al-Najjar\'s 11-year-old son was injured, along with her husband, Hamdi al-Najjar, who is in critical condition.The nine children - Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman and Sidra - were aged between just a few months old and 12. The Israeli military has said the incident is under review. Meanwhile, the Red Cross said two of its staff were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis on Saturday.The killing of Ibrahim Eid, a weapon contamination officer, and Ahmad Abu Hilal, a security guard at the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah "points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza", the ICRC said, repeating its call for a ceasefire.; On Sunday, the head of a controversial US and Israeli-approved organisation that sought to use private firms to deliver aid to Gaza resigned. In a statement by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, executive director Jake Wood said it had become apparent that plans to set up distribution hubs would not meet the "humanitarian principles" of independence and neutrality.Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March that lasted 11 weeks before it allowed limited aid to enter the territory in the face of warnings of famine and mounting international outrage.Israeli military body Cogat said on Saturday morning that 388 trucks carrying aid had entered Gaza since Monday. The UN says much more aid - between 500 to 600 trucks a day - is needed.Meanwhile, 20 countries and organisations met in Madrid on Sunday to discuss ending the war in Gaza. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an arms embargo on Israel if it did not stop its attacks.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas\'s cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 53,939 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory\'s health ministry.', 'videos': [], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xnbcf7/live/b538dc40-39e2-11f0-8947-7d6241f9fce9.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': "'Situation is dire' - BBC returns to Gaza baby left hungry by Israeli blockade", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2kd1nkleo'}, {'article_title': 'Father of nine children killed by Israeli strike still in critical condition', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8djlg3zq5o'}, {'article_title': 'US arrests man for allegedly trying to  firebomb embassy in Israel', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c780n71rr24o'}], 'keyword': 'Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 24, medics and officials say', 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:43.418Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9yjj54v3xo', 'keyword': 'Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 24, medics and officials say'}}, {'id': 'c4g2w8pqeyvo', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2w8pqeyvo', 'author': 'Ian Youngs', 'headline': "Lilo and Stitch beat Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning at box office", 'topics': [], 'publication_date': '2025-05-26T00:35:40.175Z', 'content': 'Disney\'s live-action Lilo and Stitch remake and Tom Cruise\'s supposedly final Mission: Impossible outing have opened as two of the biggest films of the year in a record-breaking weekend at the box office.Lilo and Stitch, which revisits the 2002 animated family favourite, exceeded expectations with takings of $341m (£252m) around the world.That made it the second highest opening of 2025 so far after A Minecraft Movie, Variety reported, and broke the record for the Memorial Day weekend in the US.

It\'s not called \'final\' for nothing."But some have doubts about whether it will really turn out to be the end.The blockbuster has had some rave reviews, with the Guardian calling it a "wildly entertaining adventure" in a five-star review, and Vanity Fair describing it as "a worthy send-off".However, not everyone was blown away, with the Hollywood Reporter saying it\'s "a disappointing farewell", and Mashable saying the series risked going out with the "fizzled whimper of a message self-destructing in a tape deck".; Meanwhile, Lilo and Stitch is the latest in a long line of live-action remakes of beloved Disney animations, and achieved the third-best box office opening behind 2019\'s The Lion King and 2017\'s Beauty and the Beast, Variety said.The new version stars Courtney B Vance and Zach Galifianakis alongside eight-year-old Maia Kealoha and a computer-generated cuddly runaway alien.It has also had mixed reviews, being described as "jovial, zany, and sweet" by the Daily Beast, but a "mind-numbing abomination" by the Times.', 'videos': [], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn35f1/live/da776ce0-39bc-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}, {'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xnb153/live/fa98fb10-39bc-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': "How an Australian bar was saved by Wrexham's rise", 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62nz1ygmxdo'}, {'article_title': 'How can traditional British TV survive the US streaming giants?', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2enydkew3o'}, {'article_title': 'Disney to open theme park in the Middle East', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrgr2zzv00o'}], 'keyword': 'Lilo and Stitch beat Tom Cruise in box office bonanza', 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:41.732Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2w8pqeyvo', 'keyword': 'Lilo and Stitch beat Tom Cruise in box office bonanza'}}, {'id': 'cgkdnmm8k2no', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkdnmm8k2no', 'author': 'Sean Coughlan', 'headline': 'King travels to support Canada as it fends off Trump', 'topics': [], 'publication_date': '2025-05-26T00:31:09.611Z', 'content': 'King Charles III and Queen Camilla will arrive in Canada later, for a two-day visit seen as bringing a message of support for the country in the face of threats and taunts from US President Donald Trump.Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently won a general election on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment, invited the royal couple and will hold a meeting with them during their stay in Ottawa.The King will read the "Speech from the Throne" to Canada\'s Parliament on Tuesday, the first time a monarch has delivered this for almost 50 years.It is expected to include a defence of Canada\'s sovereignty and to reject claims it should be taken over by the US.; There will be a ceremonial welcome at the airport in Ottawa on Monday and meetings with community groups, which are expected to include representatives of Canada\'s First Nation communities.The King will meet Canada\'s first indigenous Governor General Mary Simon.This is the King and Queen\'s first visit to Canada since the start of their reign, after a planned trip last year was cancelled because of King Charles\'s cancer diagnosis.By reading the Speech from the Throne the King is following in the footsteps of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who carried out the duty twice during her long reign in 1957 and 1977.But the timing of this week\'s visit has been seen as a sign of solidarity with Canada, after calls from Trump for the country to become the 51st US state.The US threat has inflamed public opinion with some businesses in Ottawa, as elsewhere in Canada, putting on displays of national identity such as "Proudly Canadian" posters.Carney, when he visited Trump at the White House earlier this month, stressed that Canada was "not for sale" and that message is likely to be conveyed in the King\'s speech which is written on the advice of Canada\'s government.; Former Canadian high commissioner to the UK Jeremy Kinsman said this was a message the King will be pleased to deliver."It\'s going to be very affirmative of Canadian sovereignty. And I can say personally that it\'s something that King Charles will celebrate saying. I have no doubt," said Mr Kinsman, who worked as a diplomat with the King when he was Prince of Wales.The speech, to be delivered in French and English, will set out the Canadian government\'s policy agenda in a way that is similar to the King\'s Speech at the State Opening of Parliament in Westminster. But it is also expected to have lines asserting the independence of Canada - a Commonwealth country and Nato member.Speaking ahead of the King\'s visit and State Opening, Carney said: "This is an historic honour which matches the weight of our times."In terms of the ceremony, the King is expected to wear a suit, in an event that will be more low key than the crown and elaborate robes on display in the UK\'s opening of Parliament.As well as the speech in Parliament, this brief trip will include community events in Ottawa and a chance to meet local leaders.This royal visit will be something of a diplomatic balancing act. The King is head of state of both Canada and the UK - and in his UK role, the King has been helping to maintain good relations with the US, sending a warm personal letter to President Trump inviting him for a second state visit.In Canada, he will be expected to reflect a very different message, with Canada\'s government rejecting Trump\'s ambition to take over the country.Ahead of the visit, a royal source said: "The King has long experience and great skill in walking that diplomatic tightrope."He\'s held in high regard around the globe and across the political spectrum, with good relations with world leaders who understand his unique position."; Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

On Friday, Trump expressed frustration with the pace of negotiations with the EU and threatened to impose 50% tariffs.Speaking to reporters, Trump said Von der Leyen told him "we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out", posting later on Truth Social that it was his "privilege to extend the deadline".; Von der Leyen earlier said she was ready to move "swiftly" to agree a trade deal with the US, but that the bloc needed until 9 July to agree a "good deal".In remarks to reporters at the White House on Friday afternoon hours before talks with the bloc, Trump said he planned to raise tariffs on all goods sent to the US from the EU to 50% by 1 June, citing impatience at negotiations. Later on Friday, the EU\'s trade chief Maroš Šefčovič reaffirmed the bloc\'s commitment to securing a fair deal.Following a call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, he said: "The EU\'s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both."He continued: "EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests."Faisal Islam: Trump\'s tariff plans could spark global economic shockSee the Trump tariffs list by countryTrump has long criticised what he views as an unfair trade relationship with the EU, despite the bloc being one of Washington\'s largest trading partners. Last year, the EU exported more than $600bn (€528bn; £443bn) in goods to the US while importing $370bn worth, according to US government data.The president has specifically raised concerns on trade in cars and agricultural goods. Although some tariffs were paused earlier this year to allow for negotiations, a 25% levy on EU steel and aluminium remains in place.European leaders continue to warn against escalation. France and Germany have called for a diplomatic solution, stressing that tariffs would harm both economies.The EU has threatened - and paused - its own measures against the US.It said it would introduce a 25% tariff on €18bn ($20bn; £15bn) worth of US goods coming into Europe but this was put on hold.The bloc is also currently consulting on additional measures against US imports into the US valued at €95bn.', 'videos': [], 'images': [{'image_url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn9112/live/002b2db0-39bc-11f0-8947-7d6241f9fce9.jpg', 'image_description': 'Main image'}], 'related_articles': [{'article_title': 'What tariffs has Trump announced and why?', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo'}, {'article_title': 'European Commission wrong to deny release of von der Leyen messages, court says', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2x7gzdr01o'}, {'article_title': 'About 20 countries could join Ukraine coalition, UK says', 'article_url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2017v5ngxpo'}], 'keyword': 'Trump agrees to extend EU trade talks after 50% tariff threat', 'timestamp': '2025-05-26T05:40:41.762Z', 'input': {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd2mz719yvo', 'keyword': 'Trump agrees to extend EU trade talks after 50% tariff threat'}}]
